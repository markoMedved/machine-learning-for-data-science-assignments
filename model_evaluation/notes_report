# explain what kind of k you choose, why did you choose this model
# leave one out - you go through all the possble models - alternative repetitions of cross validation
# TODO select k, look again into the hyperparameter selection, other stuff should be correct
# TODO why did you choose the model for the report
# different parameter in each fold is ok (evaluation of algorithm - so it's ok)

# report bias variance tradeoff
basically explain every step you took (why model, why stratified, why did you choose the k, why optimize on log loss ...)

the inner k probably doesnt have to be that big - since we dont have to decrease the variance

# Here the baseline classifier will be excluded, because it's clear that it will perform better (part 2)
